      <t>   This document complements RFC 8138 and dedicates a bit in the RPL

      <t>
      The transition of a RPL <xref target='RFC6550'/> network to activate the
      compression defined in <xref target='RFC8138'/> can only be done when all
      routers in the network support it.  A non-capable node acting as a router
      would drop the compressed packets and black-hole its subDAG. In a mixed
      case with both RFC8138-capable and non-capable nodes, the compression
      may be turned on only if all the non-capable nodes act as leaves and
      their RPL parents handle the compression/decompression on their behalf.
      </t>
      <t>
      This document complements RFC 8138 and dedicates a flag in the RPL
      configuration option to indicate whether RFC 8138 compression should be
      used within the RPL Instance. The setting of new flag is controlled by the
      Root and propagates as is in the whole network. When the bit is not set,
      source nodes that support RFC 8138 should refrain from using the
      compression unless the information is superseded by configuration.
      </t>
      <t>
      This specification provides scenarios that force a legacy node to become a
      RPL-Aware-Leaf (RAL). In that case, the 6LR must be aware by means out of
      scope that it must uncompress the packets before delivering to the RAL.

   <section><name>Updating RFC 6550</name>
   <t>
   This specification defines a new flag "Enable RFC8138 Compression" (T).
   The "T" flag is set to turn on the use of the compression of RPL artifacts
   with <xref target='RFC8138'/> within a RPL Instance. If a RPL Instance has
   multiple Roots then they must be coordinated to use the same setting.
   </t>
   <t>
   RPL defines a Configuration Option that is registered to IANA in section
   20.14. of <xref target='RFC6550'/>. The "T" flag is encoded in one of the
   reserved control bits in the RPL Configuration Option. The bit position of
   the "T" flag is indicated in <xref target='iana'/>.
   </t>

   <t>
   Section 6.3.1.
   of <xref target='RFC6550'/> defines a 3-bit Mode of Operation (MOP) in the
   DIO Base Object. The new "T" flag is defined only for MOP value between 0 to
   6. For a MOP value of 7 or above, the flag MAY indicate something different
   and MUST NOT be interpreted as "Enable RFC8138 Compression" unless the
   specification of the MOP indicates to do so.
   </t>

  <!--
   <t>
   If the "T" flag is set, a node is supposed to source packets in the
   compressed form using <xref target='RFC8138'/>. Failure to do so results
   in larger packets, yields higher risks of loss and may cause a fragmentation.

   If the node does not supports RFC 8138 then it RPL-Unaware Leaf
   (RUL) and operates as specified in <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-unaware-leaves'/>.
   </t>
-->

   <t>
   A node that supports this specification MUST source packets in the compressed
   form using <xref target='RFC8138'/> if and only if the "T" flag
   is set. This behaviour can be overridden by a configuration of the
   node in order to cope with intermediate implementations of the root that
   support <xref target='RFC8138'/> but not this specification and cannot set
   the "T" flag.
   </t>

   <t>
   The decision of using <xref target='RFC8138'/> is made by the originator of
   the packet depending on its capabilities and its knowledge of the state of
   the "T" flag.
   A router that encapsulates a packet is the originator of the resulting packet
   and decides whether to compress the outer headers as indicated above.
   An external target <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/> is not
   expected to support <xref target='RFC8138'/>.
   An intermediate router MUST forward the packet in the form that the source
   used, either compressed or uncompressed, unless it is either forwarding to an
   external target or delivering to a leaf that is not known to support RFC 8138,
   in which cases it MUST uncompress the packet.
   </t>

   <t>
   A RPL-Unaware Leaf (RUL) <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-unaware-leaves'/> is
   both a leaf and an external target. A RUL does not participate to RPL and
   depends on the 6LR to ensure its connectivity. Packets from/to a RUL are
   tunneled back and forth to the Root regardless of the MOP used in the RPL
   Instance.  A node that supports this specification but does not support
   <xref target='RFC8138'/> SHOULD join as a RUL to ensure that the 6LR is aware
   it needs to uncompress the packets before delivering.
   </t>


   </section><!-- Updating RFC 8138 -->


   <section><name>Transition Scenarios</name>
   <t>
    A node that supports <xref target='RFC8138'/> but not this specification
    can only be used in a homogeneous network and an upgrade requires a
    "flag day" where all nodes are updated and then the network is rebooted
    with implicitly RFC 8138 compression turned on with the "T" flag set on.
   </t>

   <t>
    A node that supports this specification can work in a network with RFC 8138
    compression turned on or off with the "T" flag set accordingly and in a
    network in transition from off to on or on to off (see <xref target='mig'/>).
   </t>

   <t>
    A node that does not support <xref target='RFC8138'/> can interoperate with
    nodes that do in a network with RFC 8138 compression turned off. If the
    compression is turned on, the node cannot forward compressed packets and
    therefore it cannot act as a router. It may remain connected to that network
    as a leaf, in which case it generates uncompressed packets and can receive
    packets if they are delivered by the parent 6LR in the uncompressed form.
   </t>

   <t>
   <xref target='RFC6550'/> states that "Nodes other than the DODAG root MUST
   NOT modify this information when propagating the DODAG Configuration option".
   Therefore, even a legacy parent propagates the "T" flag as set by the Root
   whether it supports this specification or not. So when the "T" flag is set,
   it is transparently flooded to all the nodes in the RPL Instance.
   </t>

   <t>Sections 8.5 and 9.2 of <xref target='RFC6550'/> also suggests that a
   RPL-aware node may only attach to a DODAG as a leaf node when the node does
   not support the Mode of Operation of a RPL Instance, the Objective Function
   (OF) as indicated by the Objective Code Point (OCP) or some other parameters
   in the configuration option.
   </t>

   <t>
   Per the above, changing the
   OCP in a DODAG can be used to force nodes that do not support a particular
   feature to join as leaf only. This specification reiterates that a
   node that is configured to operate in a RPL Instance but does not support a
   value for a known parameter that is mandatory for routing MUST NOT operate
   as a router but MAY still join as a leaf. Note that a legacy node will not
   recognize when a reserved field is now used and will not turn to a leaf
   when the "T" flag is set.
   </t>


   <t>
   The intent for this specification is to perform a migration once and for all
   without the need for a flag day. In particular it is not the intention to
   undo the setting of the "T" flag, and though it is possible to roll back
   (see <xref target='rb'/>), adding nodes that do not support
   <xref target='RFC8138'/> after a roll back may be problematic if the roll
   back is not fully complete (see caveats in <xref target='sic'/>).
   </t>

   <section anchor='mig'><name>Inconsistent State While Migrating</name>

   <t>
   When the "T" flag is turned on in the configuration option by the root, the
   information slowly percolates through the DODAG as the DIO gets propagated.
   Some nodes will see the flag and start sourcing packets in the compressed
   form while other nodes in the same RPL Instance are still not aware of it.
   Conversely, in non-storing mode, the root will start using RFC 8138 with a
   SRH-6LoRH that routes all the way to the last router or possibly to the leaf,
   if the leaf supports RFC 8138.
   </t>

   <t>
   This is why it is required that all the routers in the RPL Instance support
   <xref target='RFC8138'/> at the time of the switch, and all nodes that do not
   support <xref target='RFC8138'/> only operate as leaves.
   </t>

   <t>
   Setting the "T" flag is ultimately the responsibility of the network
   administrator. In a case of upgrading a network to turn the compression on,
   the network SHOULD be operated with the "T" flag reset until all targeted
   nodes are upgraded to support this specification.  <xref target='sic'/>
   and <xref target='dic'/> provide possible transition scenarios where this can
   be enforced.
   </t>

   </section> <!--"Transient State while migrating"-->

   <section anchor='sic'><name>Single RPL Instance Scenario</name>
   <t>
   In a Single RPL Instance Scenario, nodes that support RFC 8138 are configured
   with a new OCP, that may use the same OF operation or a variation of it. The
   root sets the "T" flag at the time it migrates to the new OCP. As a result,
   nodes that do not support RFC 8138 join as leaves and do not forward packets
   anymore. The leaves generate packets without compression. The parents
   - which supports RFC 8138 - may encapsulate the packets using RFC 8138 if
   needed. The other way around, the root encapsulates packets to the leaves all
   the way to the parent, which decapsulates and distribute the uncompressed
   inner packet to the leaf.
   </t>

   <t>
   This scenario presents a number of caveats:
   </t><ul spacing='normal'>
   <li>
   The method consumes an extra OCP. It also requires a means to signal the
   capabilities of the leaf, e.g., using <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-mopex-cap'>
   "RPL Mode of Operation extension"</xref>.
   </li>
   <li>
   If an implementation does not move to a leaf mode when the OCP is changed to
   an unknown one, then the node may be stalled.
   </li>
   <li>
   If the only possible parents of a node are nodes that do not support RFC 8138,
   then that node will loose all its parent at the time of the migration and it
   will be stalled until a parent is deployed with the new capability.
   </li>
   <li>
   Nodes that only support RFC8138 for forwarding may not parse the RPI in
   native form. If such nodes are present, the parent needs to encapsulate with
   RFC8138.
   </li>
   </ul><t>
   </t>

   </section> <!--"Single Instance Scenario"-->

   <section anchor='dic'><name>Double RPL Instances Scenario</name>
   <t>An alternate to the Single RPL Instance Scenario is to deploy an additional
   RPL Instance for the nodes that support <xref target='RFC8138'/>.
   The two RPL Instances operate independently as specified
   in <xref target='RFC6550'/>.  The preexisting RPL Instance that does not use
   <xref target='RFC8138'/>, whereas the new RPL Instance does. This is signaled
   by the "T" flag which is only set in the configuration option in DIO messages
   in the new RPL Instance.
   </t>

   <t>
   Nodes that support RFC 8138 participate to both Instances but favor the new
   RPL Instance for the traffic that they source.
   On the other hand, nodes that only support the uncompressed format would
   either not be configured for the new RPL Instance, or would be configured to
   join it as leaves only.
   </t>

   <t>
   This method eliminates the risks of nodes being stalled that are described in
   <xref target='sic'/> but requires implementations to support at least two RPL
   Instances and demands management capabilities to introduce new RPL Instances
   and deprecate old ones.
   </t>
   </section> <!-- Double Instance Scenario -->


   <section anchor='rb'><name>Rolling Back</name>

  <t>
   After downgrading a network to turn the <xref target='RFC8138'/> compression
   off, the administrator SHOULD make sure that all nodes have converged to the
   "T" flag reset before allowing nodes that do not support the compression in
   the network (see caveats in <xref target='sic'/>).
  </t>

   <t>
   It is RECOMMENDED to only deploy nodes that support <xref target='RFC8138'/>
   in a network where the compression is turned on. A node that does not support
   <xref target='RFC8138'/> MUST only be used as a leaf.
   </t>

   </section> <!-- Transition Scenarios -->

   <section anchor="iana"><name>IANA Considerations</name>
    <t>
    This specification updates the Registry for the "DODAG Configuration Option
    Flags" that was created for <xref target='RFC6550'/> as follows:
    </t>

   <table  anchor="nexndopt"><name>New DODAG Configuration Option Flag</name>
   <thead>
      <tr><td>Bit Number</td><td>Capability Description</td><td>Reference</td></tr>
   </thead><tbody>
      <tr><td>2</td><td>Turn on RFC8138 Compression (T)</td><td>THIS RFC</td></tr>
   </tbody>
   </table>

   </section>

   <section anchor='sec'><name>Security Considerations</name>
    <t>
    Setting the "T" flag before some routers are upgraded may cause a loss
    of packets. The new bit is protected as the rest of the configuration so
    this is just one of the many attacks that can happen if an attacker manages
    to inject a corrupted configuration.
    </t><t>
    Setting and resetting the "T" flag may create inconsistencies in the network
    but as long as all nodes are upgraded to RFC 8138 support they will be able
    to forward both forms. The draft insists that the source is responsible
    for selecting whether the packet is compressed or not, and all routers must
    use the format that the source selected. So the result of an inconsistency
    is merely that both forms will be present in the network, at an additional
    cost of bandwidth for packets in the uncompressed form.
